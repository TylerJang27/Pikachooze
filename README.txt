We select the open project option, with project Pikachooze.

Since our last milestone, we added the ability to add, edit, and delete pokemon for a user and for suggested trainers. We also added multiple views for the fight page based on TA’s feedback, including viewing a ranked list of pokemon, a team recommendation based on our greedy algorithm, and overall matchup chart. We also enabled users to evolve/devolve their pokemon rather than deleting and adding new ones. We added other animations, such as viewing a pokemon’s stats, and user filtering/searching for inventory and moves.

For security, we made sure that only authenticated users can access and edit specific pages, and implemented UUIDs for pokemon instances and trainers in order to obscure our implementation.

We also added numerous UI improvements.
